🏛️ Spatial Documentation of Colonial Chinese Tombs (KITLV Public Domain Data)
Project Description
This repository serves as an open collaborative hub for the spatial identification and documentation of colonial-era Chinese cemeteries across Indonesia. Utilizing Public Domain maps and archival materials from the KITLV (Leiden University) collection, the project integrates historical cartography into a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework. The goal is to provide a broad spatial overview of Tionghoa funerary heritage to support historical research and urban planning.

📍 Data Precision and Ethical Responsibility
This project provides a spatial representation of historical sites based on archival evidence. However, we explicitly state that this repository is not intended for high-precision navigation or survey-grade accuracy. Our mapping focuses on general distribution patterns and historical site locations as they appeared in colonial records.

Users must acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cultural heritage data. To prevent potential misuse, such as looting, vandalism, or unauthorized site disturbance, we emphasize that:

Responsible Use: Data must be used wisely and exclusively for educational, conservation, or research purposes.

Spatial Sensitivity: We provide generalized location markers rather than high-precision coordinates for vulnerable sites to safeguard their physical integrity.

Community Integrity: Any collaborative contributions must respect the sanctity and cultural sensitivity of these burial grounds.

📂 Commitment to FAIR Principles
To ensure the sustainability of digital heritage, this project adheres to FAIR Data standards:

Findable & Accessible: Using KITLV’s open-access repository as the primary source of truth.

Interoperable: Providing spatial data in open-source formats like GeoJSON and CSV.

Reusable: Encouraging a collaborative environment where data can be improved and analyzed by the global research community under ethical guidelines.

🛠️ Collaborative Participation
We invite historians, GIS enthusiasts, and heritage advocates to assist in georeferencing public domain maps and standardizing metadata. By participating, you agree to handle all spatial information with the utmost care and to prioritize the preservation of the physical sites over data granularity.

“Mapping the past, respecting the present: Collaborative heritage data managed with ethical foresight.”
