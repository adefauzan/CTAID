# Colonial Tomb Archive ID
Project Description
This repository serves as a decentralized collaborative hub dedicated to the spatial detection and digital documentation of colonial-era Chinese tombs in Indonesia. By leveraging Public Domain maps and archival records from the KITLV (Leiden University) collection, this project integrates historical cartography into modern Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Our mission is to transform static archival data into dynamic geospatial insights while fostering an open research community.

📍 Commitment to FAIR Principles
To ensure the sustainability of digital heritage research, this repository is managed strictly according to FAIR Data standards:

Findable: All datasets are enriched with standardized metadata and indexed via GitHub to ensure they are discoverable by the global research community.

Accessible: We utilize open-access source materials from the KITLV public domain, ensuring that data remains free and available without restrictive licensing barriers.

Interoperable: Spatial data is processed into open formats—such as GeoJSON, CSV, and KML—allowing for seamless integration across various platforms including QGIS, ArcGIS, and web-mapping tools.

Reusable: Datasets are provided with clear documentation and provenance, enabling future researchers to build upon this work for historical, sociological, or urban planning studies.

🛡️ Data Ethics & Heritage Safeguarding
In alignment with digital archaeology ethics, this project adheres to a policy of not disclosing highly specific or high-precision location data for vulnerable sites. To prevent potential looting or vandalism, our public datasets focus on macro-scale distribution patterns and spatial analysis rather than providing precise navigational coordinates for sensitive cultural assets.

📂 KITLV Open Data Utilization
The repository manages assets derived from public domain materials, including:

Historical Cartography: 19th and 20th-century city plans and cemetery (Sentiong) layouts.

Topographic Records: Lithographs and prints providing architectural and landscape contexts.

Open Metadata: Bibliographic records used for the chronological categorization of heritage sites.

🛠️ Collaborative Contribution
We invite GIS analysts, historians, and open-data advocates to contribute. Collaboration is focused on georeferencing historical maps, standardizing data attributes, and historical verification through transparent Pull Requests.

“Advancing heritage preservation through open collaboration and responsible data stewardship.”
